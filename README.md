# Audio/Video Delay
Browser extension that Delays audio and video for synchronized playback

## Privacy
Audio/Video Delay runs locally and does not collect any user data or analytics. It is fully open-source and can be freely reviewed.

## Contributions
If this extension solves your audio issues, please consider leaving a [Google review](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/audiovideo-delay/oefgkbcfnbncpbociajoehcnnmmipjmo/reviews), starring the GitHub repository, or donating to my [PayPal](https://buymeacoffee.com/cpb34). If you would like to contribute to the code, I welcome you to do so in the develop branch. Thank you!

## Limitations
- DRM-protected content can only have its audio delayed. The screen will appear black when attempting to delay DRM video.
- Subtitles are delayed only for videos on YouTube and the JW Player 

## Installation Guide
Audio/Video Delay is built for Chromium-based browsers (Brave, Chrome, Edge, etc.). You can install it through the Chrome Web Store or by manually loading it into the browser. Use the latter process if you would like to modify the code or if you just like to guarantee what is running on your computer.

### Chrome Web Store:
Audio/Video Delay is available [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/audiovideo-delay/oefgkbcfnbncpbociajoehcnnmmipjmo) and can be installed like any other extension on the Chrome Web Store

### Load Unpacked:
Audio/Video Delay can be manually loaded into the browser with the following steps:
1. Download and unzip `Audio-Video-Delay-2.4.2` from the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/cpb34/Audio-Video-Delay/releases)
2. Visit the browser extensions page and turn on Developer mode
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the unzipped folder

### Optional Font Download for Arch Linux:
Audio/Video Delay uses the Courier New and Brush Script MT fonts, which are not standard fonts on Linux. Use command `yay -S ttf-ms-fonts` to obtain these from the AUR.

## Usage Guide
For the best experience with frame-perfect playback, enable graphics acceleration in your browser and set all displays to 60fps in your computer's settings. If any display is over 60fps, frame drift may occur and the delayed video may be choppy. Only use above 60fps if your computer has a dedicated graphics card or powerful integrated graphics and can maintain a locked framerate.

### Enabling/Disabling the Extension
Enable or disable the extension by pressing the bottom button in the GUI. The current on/off state is reflected here.

### Changing Delay Modes Between Audio and Video
Video is delayed by default. Delay audio instead by clicking the yellow "Video" button at the top of the GUI. It will change to a red "Audio" button, and clicking it will return the delay mode back to video.

### Changing the Delay Amount
Input the desired delay (in milliseconds) in the middle box of the GUI; no page refresh is required.

### If Screen Tearing Occurs
NVIDIA GPU users:
- NVIDIA Control Panel -> Manage 3D Settings -> enable Vertical Sync in Global Settings or do so in Program Settings for your browser
- Set all displays to 60fps, as the delay mechanism is fundamentally different for videos at 60fps and above 60fps
- Follow potential fixes in the Intel section below
- Roll back drivers with [NVCleanstall](https://nvcleanstall.net/download) if all else fails. If on gaming drivers, try studio drivers instead.
- Send an email to support@cpb.dev with a description of your issues and I will help resolve them

AMD GPU/iGPU users:
- AMD Adrenalin Software -> Gaming -> Display -> enable VRR

Intel GPU/iGPU users:
- Experiment with resolution settings, disabling hardware acceleration in the browser (will reduce performance but will confirm it's a GPU issue), and having multiple displays active (moving the cursor to the display not containing the video may help)

Normal Instagram post videos inconsistent due to undetermined video caching logic
